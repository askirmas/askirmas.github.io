## Repositories overview

### template

https://github.com/askirmas/template

The purpose is to have a single source of configurations and stack extensions, applicable as here https://github.com/askirmas/test-/blob/master/package.json#L39-L41 for fast deployment/instantiation. 

### git-hooks-wrapper

https://github.com/askirmas/git-hooks-wrapper

Alternative to [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) with huge differences. 

### postcss-plugin-d-ts

https://github.com/askirmas/postcss-plugin-d-ts/

Solves the common issue of importing any CSS into Typescript (critical with CSS-modules) in a very strict and declarative way.

### ts-swiss

https://github.com/askirmas/ts-swiss

Fix typescript lib's issues and has many useful generics - much more than [utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types)

### render-on-demand

https://github.com/askirmas/render-on-demand

DOM optimization: Render/Mount/Construct on demand via IntersectionObserver. One of useful scenarios â€“ many tabs with thousands children in each as uncontrolled elements only.

### no-js

PureCss as KISS principle https://github.com/askirmas/no-js/

#### Resize bar

https://github.com/askirmas/no-js/tree/master/resizebar

Easy applicable and with information hiding ([don't intercharge with encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding#Overview)) in case of events because resolved by browser. 

Demo for Chrome: https://askirmas.github.io/no-js/resizebar/demo.html. Firefox TBD

#### Minimal Material

https://github.com/askirmas/no-js/tree/master/minimal-material

I started recompiling Google's SASS implementation of Material Design to make it much easier to apply by pseudo-elements usage.

##### Material Ripple Effect

https://askirmas.github.io/no-js/minimal-material/sandbox/rippling.html

2nd and 3rd `<div> ` has the same CSS and with help of 1-line JS handler the 3rd has 'positioned' ripple effect.

### contracts

https://github.com/askirmas/contracts

Sort out in 1 place all known modellers like JsonSchema, TypeScript, MySQL, MongoDB, etc. Later, collect mapping tools.
